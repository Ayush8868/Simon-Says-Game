# Simon-Says-Game
Simon Says is a memory game where players must remember and repeat a sequence of colors. In this JavaScript implementation, the game initializes with an empty sequence for both the game and the user. When a key is pressed, the game starts, and the level increases. Each level adds a new color to the sequence, which flashes on the screen.
To play, simply press any key to start the game. Then, click on the colored buttons to replicate the sequence presented by the game. If successful, the game progresses to the next level. If not, the game ends, displaying the final score.
